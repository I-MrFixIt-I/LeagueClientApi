# LeagueClientApi
C# Wrapper for the new LeagueClient

The LeagueClientApi is still under development and currently only supports the rune-book (retrieving and saving it), because this was the only thing I need for my project.

To clarify, this is NO Wrapper for the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
Since this isn't a wrapper for the Riot Games API, you don't need an API for anything.

## Features

- Modify your rune-book
- You need more features? Simply open an issue and ask for it there :)

## Libraries used

This wrapper uses [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

## License

This wrapper is under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
